# BTR Formatting

We want our essays to get feedback. So here's a way to ensure we'll get that bread. 

Here are BTR's feedback diktats:

- 12pt header of the format
```
Critical Reflection
Sem 2, AY 2022/2023
Learning In- and Outside the Classroom
```
- 14pt text, double-spaced
- 1.25" margins, all sides
- Wordcount and matric # at bottom of document
- No free floating pointer words (`this`, `that`, `these`, `those`)
- No use of `as such`
- Page numbers on each page
